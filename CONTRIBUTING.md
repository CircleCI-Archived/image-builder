# Contributing to CircleCI Image Builder

We welcome all contributions to CircleCI Image Builder.
These contributions come in two forms: issues and pull requests.

## Issues

If you spot anything
that conflicts with our values,
opening a GitHub Issue is a great way
to give us specific feedback.

To make an issue,
refer to the [GitHub Issues Workflow](https://github.com/circleci/circleci-docs/wiki/GitHub-Issues-Workflow) wiki page.

## Pull Requests

If you feel motivated,
you can make documentation changes
and submit a pull request.

For minor changes like typos,
You can submit a pull request for your changes directly in our repository.

For larger edits or new documents,
[set up a local environment](local-development.md).
When you are satisfied with your changes,
create a pull request from your branch
by following [GitHub's guide](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

Regardless of the size of your change,
do read through our [Style Guide](https://github.com/circleci/circleci-docs/wiki/Style-Guide).

### Titles and Descriptions

Pull request titles should be descriptive enough
for reviewers to understand *what* is being changed.
Some ways of doing this are better than others:

| Original Pull Request Title | Better Title                                                               |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _Updating file.md_          | _Indicate support for environment variables in context paths_            |
| _Sidebar changes_           | _Move Deployment to its own navigation section for better organization_  |

Every pull request should have a description
that explains *why* the change is being made.
The description adds context
that is critical for reviewers when giving feedback.
